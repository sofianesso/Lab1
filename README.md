Lab1 â€“ Find numbers in string of characters

Create a console application that takes a text string (string) as input.
The text string must then be searched for all substrings that are numbers that start and end with the same number, without the start/end number, or any other character than numbers appearing in between. The program must also add up all the numbers it found as above and print it last in the program.
